# Decentralized exchange
## Concept
**Swarmfund** gives an opportunity to exchange assets within the 
system by creating an offer. Basically, offer tells between which assets 
exchange will be performed (base and quote), amount and desirable price
for exchange. Source account must hold balances in base and quote 
assets and corresponding asset pair should exist.  
Then, selling amount will be locked on balance to exchange from. 
If there's an available offer which meets our requirement,
the offer will be fulfilled and exchange will be performed. In another case, 
offer is posted in the **orderbook**, where it's stored until 
an appropriate offer received.
